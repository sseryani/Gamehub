## Using the App

* When you open the app it will ask you to sign up/ sign in with an email and password.
* After signing up/in it will take you to the main screen, where you can choose to play any of the three games.
* For SlidingTiles it will first take you to another screen where you can choose the difficulty level (size of the board).
* For MatchingCards it will take you to the game, then it will show you some cards for a brief moment and then flip them. You have to find pairs of cards from memory, and if you find them all you win.
* For TicTacToe it will take you to the game and you have to beat an opponent, it's a classic game of tic tac toe.
