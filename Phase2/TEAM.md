## Team Contract

* I will get my allotted work done on time.
* I will attend every team meeting and actively participate.
* Should an emergency arise that prevents me from attending a team
meeting, I will notify my team immediately.
* The work will be divided roughly equally among all team members.
* I will help my team to understand every concept in the project.
* If I do not understand a concept or code, I will immediately ask my
team for help.

## Work individually / in pairs

Everybody will work on some part individually, and then in pairs for the
database implementation and for the QA of their code.

## Note Taker

The designated note taker will be set for each meeting. The meeting
notes will be shared through the Facebook group chat.

All decisions made during the meeting, such as who will be responsible
for which tasks, and the order in which the tasks need to be done, will
be specified on the TASKS.md file.
